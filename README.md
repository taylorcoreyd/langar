# langAR

langAR is a new way to immerse yourself in learning a foreign language through the use of augmented reality.


## Introduction

People learn languages better when they relate words to tangible items, and langAR gives you that opportunity from the convinience of your office desk. Now you can see a dog sitting on your desk, and establish a strong connection with it - "đây la một con cho!".

langAR utilizes an already refined Augmented Reality interface (provided by Apple and available on modern iPhones and iPads) to generate models on any surface, and then quiz you on the items you see.

From the system we have created, we see a set of endless possibilities: expansion into all languages, complex grammatical structures, and scores and rewards to keep you motivated in your desire to learn a new language. 加油!

## Inspiration

Language is what brings people together, and keeps us apart. If you prefer to make the world a more accessible place, then there's no such thing as too many ways of keeping language-learning fresh and exciting.

With augmented reality within the reach of everyone (and at their fingertips), now is the time to use this technology to learn a new language.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

langAR is still in its development phase, but if you want to experience it in its early stages, you can find all necessary code in this repository.

langAR requires building from a MacBook onto a newer iPhone or iPad (any device with Augmented Reality capabilities). This also requires a developer key (available through Apple).

### Installing

Clone (or download) [the repository](https://github.com/taylorcoreyd/langar) into a local drive.

Open the `langar.xcodeproj` file in Xcode. 

Connect your iDevice, and allow augmented reality. Then, under the device menu on the top panel, select your connected device from the list of available devices and emulators. Click the play button.


## Using langAR

Hold your device steady while having the camera pointed at a flat horizontal surface. Click on the screen to place an object, then select the right answer. Thats's it!
